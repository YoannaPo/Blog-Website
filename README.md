## General info
Personal blog - a website that uses only HTML and CSS. It also includes custom images, layout, style and mockup design (I created in Adobe XD).

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS

## Process 
Before coding the website - I designed style guide, colour palette and the entire layout following Mobile First Approach. I worked in Adobe XD. I prepared wireframes for each of the subpages and then a clickable prototype. Below is an excerpt from the results of this process
